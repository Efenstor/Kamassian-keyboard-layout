# Kamassian-keyboard-layout

Linux shell script that installs the Kamassian keyboard layout (Cyrillic characters).

Does install, uninstall and test install. Requires *xmlstarlet*. Hopefully Bourne Shell-compatible.

The CLI is in Russian but everything else, including internal comments, is in English, so it is easily translatable and may be used as a template for those who wish to make their own custom keyboard layout installer.
